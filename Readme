access frontend app at http://localhost:3000/
access api via HTTP GET localhost:8888/shipments


To keep within 2-3 hours of constrain set by myself, 
here is the very simple basic solution that shows the user the shipments that's failed
so that the manager could start trace by id and start contacting customers.


The FE could definitely improve on things such as 
1. adding filter to the table status column, adding more action buttons to help manager track those customers they have contacted. add pagination to reduce server load.
2. headers and navigation to make prettier.
3. organize files better, break down app into pieces if more api added
4. add more tests to ensure



For BE could definitely improve on things such as
1. crediential storage
2. rate and size limiting

Further thoughts,
with more api/data and time given, we could start to 
1. automatically send emails/text to the customers regarding the shipment status. 
2. push notification to manager and client if any shipment turn to failed status.
